# Deployment

* This project and all project files are hosted on GitHub via my GitHub repository at <a href="" target="_blank"></a>
* I coded the project using GitPod as my development environment. 
* To deploy the project 
   1. I began by adding the files using the command 'git add filename' in the command prompt.
   2. I then used commits regularly while coding using the command 'git commit -m "commit message here". 
   3. I then pushed the committed files from the GitPod IDE to the master branch of the main repository on GitHub.
   4. After pushing the files I went to my repository.
   5. I clicked on the 'Settings' tab near the top of the page and scrolled down to the 'GitHub Pages' section.
   6. I selected the Source as the 'Master Branch' as all the site content and files are stored in and built from the 'Master Branch'.
   7. GitHub provided me with a direct link to the deployed site.
   8. You can view the deployed site here: <a href="" target="_blank"></a>

## There are no differences between the currently deployed site and the development version at this time.

## To run the project locally

To clone this project from GitHub:

* Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
  1. In the Clone with HTTPs section, copy the clone URL for the repository ( For this repository:  ).
  2. In your local IDE open Git Bash.
  3. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
  4. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.
  5. The command should look like this:  git clone 
  6. Press enter and your local clone will be created and the response should be something like this:
> * $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> * Cloning into `Spoon-Knife`...
> * remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
> * remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
> * remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)

# To preview in your browser

If you are using gitpod as your IDE:
The project runs only from the Master branch the main directory of which is:  /workspace/everyday-gourmet
When in the main directory enter the following into the command prompt
1. python3 -m http.server
2. This will run the contents of the directory on a local web server, on port 8000.
3. If you are working in Gitpod this will give you an option to 'open browser' which will open the default 'index.html'
4. If you want to stop the local server from running simply press crtl + C

## Acknowledgements

## Thank you SO SO MUCH to my mentor **@rheyannmagcalas_mentor** for all the help and great tips she gave me while I was developing and then working on this project and for helping me to finally solve the issue with my API GET script... I agonized for 5 days unable to get it to work and in the end it was such a simple fix and I was overcomplicating my code.
## Thank you to h4xnoodle for your advice and consistently reminding me not to overcomplicate things.
